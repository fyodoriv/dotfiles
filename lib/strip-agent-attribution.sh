# strip-agent-attribution.sh — shared helper that enforces the
# agent-attribution-footer rule on git commit messages.
#
# Sourced by:
#   - git-hooks/commit-msg     (global hook)
#   - ~/.config/husky/init.sh  (husky-managed repos)
#
# Exposes one function:
#   _strip_agent_attribution_in_file <path-to-commit-msg>
#
# Behavior:
#   1. Removes vendor-specific attribution lines that any AI agent
#      (Devin, Claude, Cursor, Windsurf, Copilot, Aider, Augment, …)
#      auto-inserts: `Generated with [<Agent>](<url>)` footers and
#      `Co-Authored-By: <Agent> <bot@…>` trailers (case-insensitive
#      header — catches both `Co-Authored-By:` and `Co-authored-by:`).
#   2. If we stripped any vendor line, appends the canonical
#      tool-neutral footer ("not <first name>") so readers can still tell the commit
#      was agent-authored.
#      The footer goes before a trailing git trailer block (Task:,
#      Signed-off-by:) so git still parses those trailers.
#   3. Orchestrator pipelines (e.g. minsky) are exempt — set
#      MINSKY_PIPELINE=1 to bypass entirely. Bypass mode preserves
#      the caller's commit message as-is so the orchestrator stays
#      in control of attribution. Minsky deliberately has no bot
#      identity (see minsky user-story 012); the operator's own
#      identity is the correct author for orchestrator-driven runs.
#
# Why a shared library: Husky overrides core.hooksPath (it points at
# .husky/_), which makes the global commit-msg hook irrelevant inside
# Husky-managed repos. We solve that by also sourcing this library
# from ~/.config/husky/init.sh, which Husky's runner sources before
# every hook invocation. One source of truth, two callers, zero
# repos slip through.

# Names and bot-account email patterns of known AI coding agents.
# Grow these as new agents are adopted — match the product name or
# the agent's bot-account email, never the human's email.
